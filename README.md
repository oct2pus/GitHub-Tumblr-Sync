# GitHub-Tumblr-Sync
Syncs a tumblr blog and a github commits


Use 'Bundle Install' to install the gems, fill out `.config.rb` and rename it to `config.rb`


Intended to be a simple scriptlet to help me automate [jadebot's](https://github.com/oct2pus/jadebot) [tumblr devlopment blog](https://jadebot-discord.tumblr.com/), I'm attempting to write this so you can just fill in the blanks in `.config.rb`, rename it, and be good to go.
