# GitHub-Tumblr-Sync
Syncs a tumblr blog and a github commits

# Dependencies
Install bundler with `gem install bundler` and then do `bundle install` to install the gems required, fill out `.config.rb` and rename it to `config.rb`, put it on a server and let it run and you're good to go. You will need to supply your own OAuth passcodes. The final 3 values are my personal values for those but feel free to change them, just be mindful of your rate limit.

# Purpose
Github-Tumblr-Sync is intended to be a simple scriptlet to help me automate [jadebot's](https://github.com/oct2pus/jadebot) [tumblr devlopment blog](https://jadebot-discord.tumblr.com/), I also wanted to write this so anyone who was interested in this kind of functionality would be able have something working in less than 10 minutes.
